## About Proportional Calculator

Proportional Calculator is a desktop application for Windows.  

Used to scale an object proportionally, given the height and width of an object and one or  
more limiting factors ( *square footage, max height or max width* ). 

If you simply need a calculator to find the square footage of an object measured  
in inches or feet; or someone needs to know how large or small an object will proportionally  
scale, *Proportional Calculator* is the right tool.  

In the **Basic** view, just enter the current height and width to get the square footage from  
inches or feet.

While in the **Advanced** view, entering the *current height and width* along with either  
*max height, max width or max square footage*, the calculator will return the largest possible  
size the object can be while meeting the given parameters.
